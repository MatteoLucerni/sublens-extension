# Subtitle Lens

A Chrome extension (Manifest V3) that blurs subtitles until you want to read them, and turns subtitle words into clickable translations and dictionary lookups.

Supports Netflix and YouTube. The extension is built around a platform adapter so other streaming platforms can be added later without changing its identity.

## Features

- **Subtitle blur**: subtitles are blurred by default; hover over a line to reveal it.
- **Auto-pause on hover**: hovering a subtitle pauses the video so you can read it.
- **Auto-reveal on pause**: pausing the video reveals all blurred subtitles.
- **Jump to previous subtitle**: pressing the Left Arrow key replays the previous subtitle line (instead of the player's default rewind).
- **Per-platform on/off**: master toggles to enable or disable the extension on Netflix and on YouTube independently (turn both off to disable it everywhere).
- **Word translation and dictionary**: click a word for its translation and dictionary entry, Ctrl+click to add more words to the selection, or click-and-drag to select a phrase.
- **Language selection**: choose the subtitle (source) language, or leave it on "Auto" to detect it from the active player caption track, and the language to translate into.

On YouTube, both manual and auto-generated captions are supported; the captions must be enabled in the player (CC button). On YouTube the supported pages are `youtube.com/watch`.

The four behaviors above are toggleable from the extension's toolbar popup and default to enabled (matching the extension's original always-on behavior); the subtitle and translation languages are configurable in the same popup.

## File structure

```
manifest.json     MV3 manifest
background.js     Service worker: platform-aware player seek + Google Translate requests
content.css       Styles for the subtitle overlay and dictionary popup
popup.html/css/js Toolbar action popup with the settings controls
icons/            Extension icons (16/32/48/128 px)
```

The content-script logic is split across several classic scripts that share one
isolated-world scope and are loaded in this exact order (see `manifest.json`):

```
settings.js       Shared chrome.storage.sync helpers + language list
platforms.js      Platform adapter (Netflix/YouTube): selectors, seek, lang detection
core.js           Config constants, shared state, base helpers
overlay.js        Subtitle overlay: styles, positioning, tokenizing, reconcile, blur/reveal
cues.js           Cue history + Left Arrow back-jump navigation
interaction.js    Word/phrase selection (click/Ctrl+click/drag) + translation popup
content.js        Entry point: subtitle discovery, onboarding, init + event wiring
```

The order matters: these files share globals, and only `content.js` (loaded last)
runs top-level code.

## Development setup

1. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome.
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top right).
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select this repository's root folder.
4. Open a Netflix video or a YouTube `/watch` video with subtitles enabled.

## Permissions

- `scripting`: used to inject a script into the page's main world to call the internal player API (Netflix seek and YouTube source-language detection).
- `storage`: used by `chrome.storage.sync` to persist the settings.
- `host_permissions` for `netflix.com` and `youtube.com` (content script) and `translate.googleapis.com` (background fetches for translation/dictionary data).

## Settings popup

Click the extension icon in the toolbar to open the settings popup. It holds the subtitle and translation language selects, the **Enable on Netflix** / **Enable on YouTube** master toggles (which turn the extension on or off per platform), and the four behavior toggles under "advanced options". Each control has a "?" icon with a hover tooltip explaining its effect in detail. Settings are stored via `chrome.storage.sync` and applied live, no page reload required.

## Word interaction guide

- **Click** a word to see its translation and dictionary definition.
- **Ctrl+Click** additional words to combine them into one selection before looking them up.
- **Click and drag** across multiple words to select a phrase.

## Versioning

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Every change bumps `manifest.json`'s `version` field and is recorded in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). See the project-level `CLAUDE.md` (local, not committed) for the exact versioning policy used by Claude Code when working on this repository.
